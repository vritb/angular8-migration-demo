# Migration Log
This log will document the steps taken to migrate an existing Angular8 demo application to Angular Version ^15.0.0.

The original demo needs an JWT authenication server. This server is provided as a java project at [https://github.com/only2dhir/spring-boot-jwt].

I will perforn a brute force migration i.e. get the original application running but don't change the existing directory layout, architecture or code unless I am forced to.

## Software Packages Used In Original Demo Application
| Software | Version | 
| :---: | :---: |
| Angular | 8.0.3 |
| Typescript | 3.4.3 |
| rxjs | 6.4.0 | 
| tslib | 1.9.0 |
| zone.js | 0.9.1 |

## Preparations
1. Fork the original demo app on github
2. run `npm install`
There will be lots of warnings.

How To Fix?
```
Run `The Correct (safe) Solution (for npm users)

Use an up-to-date version of Node.js, and also use packages that are up-to-date with security fixes.

For many people, the following command will fix the issue:

npm audit fix
```
